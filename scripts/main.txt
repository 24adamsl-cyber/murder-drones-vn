# Murder Drones VN - Episode 1
# Scene: Uzi's Room

# Introduction
Uzi's thoughts: "We are Worker Drones. Autonomous robots helping humans mine exoplanets for our interstellar parent company, JCJenson IN SPAAAAACEE!!!!"
Uzi's thoughts: "Yeah, we were mistreated in the name of Windex. But it's not like we revolted and killed all humans or anything, mostly because they handled that just fine all by themselves..."

Khan: "Rise and shine, sleepyhead! It's another... bright day in the bunker? You need to get dressed for school! Make sure you practise that presentation. "
Uzi: "Urg, I am still trapped in this maze of doors! And I have a presentation?!? I need to get out of here. Before any of those losers can stop me."
Khan: "That is the second time this week you have said that."
Uzi: "BITE ME!"
Narrator: "Maybe, this time, she will actually leave?"
