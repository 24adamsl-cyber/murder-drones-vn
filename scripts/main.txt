# Murder Drones VN - Episode 1
# Scene: Uzi's Room

# Introduction
Uzi's thoughts: "We are Worker Drones. Autonomous robots helping humans mine exoplanets for our interstellar parent company, JCJenson IN SPAAAAACEE!!!!"
Uzi's thoughts: "Yeah, we were mistreated in the name of Windex. But it's not like we revolted and killed all humans or anything, mostly because they handled that just fine all by themselves..."
Uzi's thoughts: "Come on. Just wake up already Uzi. It is pointless practicing your presentation now."
Khan: "Rise and shine, sleepyhead! It's another... bright day in the bunker? You need to get dressed for school! Make sure you practise that presentation. :D "
Uzi: "Urg, I am still trapped in this maze of doors! And I have a presentation?!? I need to get out of here. Before any of those losers can stop me."
Khan: "That is the second time this week you have said that."
Uzi: "BITE ME!"
Uzi's thoughts: "Maybe, this time, I will actually leave?"

Uzi's thoughts: "Huh. I thought there would be some drones here. I guess i should go..."
Uzi's thoughts: "What is that?"
Narrator: "Suddenly, a disassembly drone leapt out out of the shadows."
Narrator: "Surprised, Uzi grabs for a, rather conveniently, placed arm and slaps the Drones"

N: "Hehe, ow! Did you just slap me with that arm? :P "
Uzi: "Holy cr@p, it talks."
